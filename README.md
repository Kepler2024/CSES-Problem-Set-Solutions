# CSES Problem Set Solutions

My personal solutions to problems from the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/) since 2026/1/27.

## About CSES

CSES (Code Submission Evaluation System) is a collection of competitive programming practice problems maintained by the University of Helsinki. The problem set covers essential algorithms and data structures topics commonly seen in competitive programming.

## Language

All solutions are written in **C++**.

## Compilation

To compile and run any solution:

```bash
g++ -std=c++20 -O2 -Wall solution.cpp -o solution
./solution
```

## Notes

- Some problems have multiple solution approaches (e.g., bit manipulation vs. backtracking)
- Solutions prioritize clarity and correctness over extreme optimization
